                    <p>Many people are unemployed and have a skill through which they can make their survival more efficient. But the challenges faced by them is that firstly there is lack of awareness of how the technology can help them in showcasing their products, exploitation by middlemen. Secondly, they are clueless of where their product has high demand and value, which can be further briefed as “Sellers don’t know where they need to sell their products for better reach and whether their product is useful to someone” and “Buyers don’t know where the products are manufactured”.The solution is that we planned to design a user-friendly application that allows sellers to upload pictures and videos of their products and the nearby courier services can also register and provide their services. Once after uploading, the quality check and price validation teams come into the scene and verifies whether the details of the product are true to their knowledge and then the seller's product will be kept live. All these sellers of each city are divided into groups based on the products they make. For each group, a team leader is being assigned who acts as a single point of contact for the seller and the team. The team leaders will be the rural and urban youth for which the problem of unemployability can be decreased. These leads train the rural artisans on how to meet modern needs and help them to design products that meet the modern edge of global markets. We research and collect the data from various sources and analyse them to find the demand-supply ratio of resources and services, chances of entrepreneurship. Here the sellers can be farmers too in a way that the unused farm resources (or) by-products can be used as raw material for some other production. To address the issue of awareness of how technology is used these days, we are connecting engineers, technocrats who are ready for voluntary service to teach them. The sellers are notified of different events conducted globally. </p>
